## About Luminar Neo

Luminar Neo is a next-generation photo editing application that leverages advanced artificial intelligence to simplify complex editing tasks and unlock new creative possibilities. It's built for photographers of all levels who want to achieve professional results faster, whether they're processing a batch of travel photos or creating a stunning composite image. The AI tools handle tedious work like selecting skies, detecting faces, and removing distractions with remarkable accuracy, freeing you to focus on the artistic vision of your image rather than manual selections and masks.

The application stands out by blending cutting-edge AI with a robust traditional editing toolkit. You can start with an AI-powered preset or suggestion and then dive into precise adjustments for color, tone, detail, and local edits. Its modular approach, with dedicated "Extensions" for specific tasks like panorama stitching or HDR merging, makes it highly adaptable. While it can serve as a powerful standalone editor, it also functions as a plug-in for Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, integrating seamlessly into existing professional workflows. Luminar Neo represents a shift towards intelligent, assistive editing that empowers creativity.
